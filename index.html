                <h1>Welcome,</h1>
                <p>This website is made by students, for students. Our aim is to guide students new in Sheffield and shed some light on the extremely intricate Student's Union building, which sits opposite to the Molecular Biology Department and right next to the imposing Hick's Building. The reason why we made this website is that we know how baffling it was for us to navigate the building when we first arrived at the university. <br><br>On this website you will find information about places where you can eat, different student services and also we will try to present you how a typical week looks like for a Computer Science student.<br><br> We would also like to mention that this website is not the official SU website.</p>
